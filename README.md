For this project, we were led towards WebXR, an API developed for web browsers. Coupled with hosting on GitHub Pages, this project's goal was to host an application similar to a previous project where we used Unity and Vuforia to show personal links when an image is recognized.

Unlike that project, this one does not revolve around recognition, but can be accessed by anyone scanning this QR Code: [QR Code provided](./QR_Code.png)
